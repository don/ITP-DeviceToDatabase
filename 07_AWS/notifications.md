# Notifications

Create rules to notify you when the temperature exceeds a certain limit.

## SNS
Log into the AWS console and open the [Simple Notification Service (SNS) dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard).

Create a new standard topic `high-temperature-notification`.

Ensure you receive an email from AWS.

For fancier notification emails, look into [AWS Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

## SMS

AWS can send also send SMS messages for SNS topics. However, the requirements changed in 2021 and it's no longer feasable to set up a SNS subscription from the demo accounts. If you're in your own AWS account, feel free to configure SMS.
