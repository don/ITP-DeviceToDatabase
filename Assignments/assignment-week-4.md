# Assignment - Week 4

## Assignment: Read

 Read [InfluxDB Key Concepts](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/key_concepts/). Note that you should be reading the older **v1.8** documentation.

## Assignment: Review

Review the [SQLite material](../03_RelationalDatabases/sqlite.md) material we covered in class. Run the example queries against your farm.db database to get a better understanding of how they work. Modify the queries to get different data. Try and adapt some PostgreSQL queryies.

## Assignment: SQL

1) Create a SQLite database by exporting the `itp` sensor_data from PostgreSQL. Follow the [instructions](../03_RelationalDatabases/sqlite.md#create-a-database-with-itp-sensor-data) to get started. Document the steps you took to create the database. A screenshot of the terminal or cmd prompt is fine. Make sure your database includes the person and device tables. Optionally create some views.

2) Write some queries using your new SQLite database of ITP sensor data. Refer to the [SQLite](../03_RelationalDatabases/sqlite.md) and [PostgreSQL](../03_RelationalDatabases/postgres.md) queries we went over in class. Experiment. Spend some time trying to use queries to answer questions with data.

3) Write about your experience about using relational datatbases. Maybe things you learned, or PostgreSQL vs SQLite, or whatever. It doesn't need to be formal, think short blog rather than academic paper.
