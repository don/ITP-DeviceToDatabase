## Assignment: Read

 * [Why SQL is beating NoSQL, and what this means for the future of data](https://blog.timescale.com/why-sql-beating-nosql-what-this-means-for-future-of-data-time-series-database-348b777b847a/)

## Assignment: Review

Review the details of the Postgres queries we covered in class. I recommended that you run the queries against the databases to get a better understanding of how they work. Modify the queries to get different data.

* [PostgreSQL Sensor Data Queries](../03_RelationalDatabases/postgres2.md)
* [PostgreSQL Additional Queries](../03_RelationalDatabases/postgres3.md)

Review the SQLite material we covered in class. Ensure that you're able to create, populate, and query SQLite databases on your machine. 

* [SQLite](../03_RelationalDatabases/sqlite.md)

## Assignment: SQL

1) Practice writing SQL queries against the `itp` and `farm` databases.

2) Use the `farm` PostgreSQL database. Write queries to answer the following questions:

   a. When did the outside sensor break and stop sending data? <br/>
   b. Show the min and max temperature in the root cellar by year <br/>
   c. What was the lowest temperature recorded in 2018? <br/>

  Challenge: Which sensor recorded the lowest temperature 2018 and when? Hint: you need a subquery.

3) Write two queries that use data from your sensor.

  Optional: write a blog post about the queries and results for your sensor data
